Phonepe Pulse Data Visualization and Exploration
PhonePe Pulse is a feature within the PhonePe mobile application that provides users with insights and data visualizations related to their financial transactions and spending patterns. This tool allows users to explore and understand their financial behavior.

Phonepe Pulse Data Visualization and Exploration is a Python project aimed at analyzing and visualizing data from the Phonepe Pulse platform. This project utilizes various data visualization techniques to gain insights into the trends, patterns, and user behavior within the Phonepe ecosystem.

Technologies Used
Python: The core programming language used for developing the application logic and backend functionality. Pandas: Data manipulation and analysis library used for working with structured data. Plotly: Interactive visualization library used for creating interactive and customizable plots and charts. SQL: Structured Query Language is used for managing and querying the database. Streamlit: The web application framework used for building interactive and data-driven applications in Python.

Features
Data Analysis: Utilize Python libraries such as Pandas to preprocess and analyze data from Phonepe Pulse. Data Visualization: Use Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly to create insightful visualizations such as bar charts, line plots, and heatmaps to represent key metrics and trends. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Conduct exploratory data analysis to uncover patterns, correlations, and outliers in the data. Interactive Dashboards: Create interactive dashboards using libraries like Streamlit to provide users with an intuitive interface for exploring the data.
